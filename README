    NTK Widgets

```
Please note AVTK superseeds this project : this is a backup repository of
legacy code, in order to keep it online. It is probably not of any use.
```

This is a set of widgets for NTK, the Non-Tool-Kit 
(http://non.tuxfamily.org/wiki/NTK) which is in turn based on FLTK 
(http://www.fltk.org).

The reason this set of widget has been created is to ease the
creation of new audio visual interfaces. Sliders, buttons and
audio / video specific widgets are provided, and accessible
trough the fantastic Ntk-fluid program.
