    AVTK: Audio Visual TooKit
    openavproductions.com/avtk

This "toolkit" is actually a set of widgets for use with NTK,
the Non-Tool-Kit (http://non.tuxfamily.org/wiki/NTK) which is
in turn based on FLTK (http://www.fltk.org).

The reason this set of widget has been created is to ease the
creation of new audio visual interfaces. Sliders, buttons and
audio / video specific widgets are provided, and accessible
trough the fantastic Ntk-fluid program.

Hope you enjoy the creation of your new interface!
